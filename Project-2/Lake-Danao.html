                <p>Lake Danao National Park is located northeast of Ormoc City, sitting among the mountain ranges. It is a popular tourist destination that both locals and tourists go back to. It has a distinct violin shape covering 148 hectares, and has a volcanic origin. Staying in Lake Danao feels cooler than normal because it sits 700 meters above sea level.</p>
                <p>Lake Danao is popular for kayaking, swimming, and fishing. It is a habitat for catfish, carp, Indian milkfish, tilapia, and giant eels. There are locals around the park who offer a ‘paluto’ service using fresh produce from the lake.
                The lake might be the main attraction, but the park offers a whole lot of other fun activities you can do!</p>
