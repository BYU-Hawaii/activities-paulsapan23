                <p>Quadro Foodie Market was founded by three enthusiastic individuals who shared the same goal of opening a weekend food market in the province of Leyte. In its first-ever season, Quadro opened its doors to the public in the city of beautiful people, Ormoc, and catered to young professionals and other workers of the city.</p>
                <p>The founders said that the idea was inspired by similarly-styled food markets in Cebu and Manila.</p>
