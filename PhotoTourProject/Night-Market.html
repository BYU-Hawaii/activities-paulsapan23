    <p>Quadro Foodie Market was founded by 3 enthusiastic people who shared the same goal of opening a weekend
        food market in the province of Leyte. In its firrst eveerr season, Quadro opened its door to the public in 
        the city of beautiful people, Ormoc and catered to young professionals and other workers of the city.

        The founders said that the idea was inspired by similarly-styled food markets in Cebu and Manila.
