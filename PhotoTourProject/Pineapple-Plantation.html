        When in Ormoc City, never miss tasting its famous “Queen Pineapple” that has a distinct sweetness. Recently, the unofficial city icon was given a fitting 
        tribute in the first Piña Festival on June 25 with a jovial event that featured a street dancing competition, a ritual/showdown, and the crowning of the Festival Queen.<br>
        <br>“Pinya is Ormoc’s pride. We want to celebrate our Queen Table Pineapple,” said Ormoc City Mayor Richard Gomez. Ormoc City Representative Lucy Torres-Gomez is proud that the 
        pineapple is the star product of the city, which gives the city an identity.<br>
        <br>The SAL Pineapple Plantation is one of Ormoc’s tourist spots. Located in Brgy. Hibunawon and owned by the Locsins (family of the city vice mayor), visitors can enjoy the 
        view of hectare upon hectare of pineapples while eating slices of the freshly picked fruit from the plantation.

    <h2> What is Queen Pineapple?</h2>
    <p>The Queen Pineapple (Formosa variety, Ananas comosus [Linn.] Merr.) is known as the sweetest pineapple in the world. The fruit has a distinct aromatic sweetness and crispiness,
         and is relatively smaller than other pineapple varieties as it only weighs around 450 grams to 950 grams. The Queen Pineapple (QP) is best eaten fresh, but it can also be used to produce fresh juice extracts, and processed into jam and dry fruit snacks. Piña cloth, used in making barongs, gowns, coin purses and pouch bags, is a customary byproduct of pineapples.</p>
