    <p> 
        Lake Danao National Park is located northeast of Ormoc City, sitting among the mountain ranges. It is a popular tourist
         destination that both locals and tourists go back to. It has a distinct violin shape covering 148 hectares, and has a 
         volcanic origin. Staying in Lake Danao feels cooler than normal because it sits 700 meters above sea level.<br>
    <br> 
         Lake Danao is popular for kayaking, swimming, and fishing. It is a habitat for catfish, carp, Indian milk fish, tilapia and giant eels. 
         There are locals around the park who offer a ‘paluto’ service using fresh produce from the lake.<br>
    <br> 
         The lake might be the main attraction, but the park offers a whole lot of other fun activities you can do!
